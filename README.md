Backlog Board
=========================

## Overview
This app utilizes a custom SDK2 Rally cardboard to display PI cards in project (team) columns 
allowing the user to drag-and-drop PIs into other projects backlogs. You can also add new items 
to the scoped project backlog.

The current version defaults to using your currently scoped project and direct children as project 
columns for the board.
